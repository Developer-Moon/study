# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# Basic Datasets question
#
# For this task you will train a classifier for Iris flowers using the Iris dataset
# The final layer in your neural network should look like: tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
# The input layer will expect data in the shape (4,)
# We've given you some starter code for preprocessing the data
# You'll need to implement the preprocess function for data.map

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
data = tfds.load("iris", split='train')

def preprocess(features):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # Should return features and one-hot encoded labels
    return f,l

def solution_model():
    train_dataset = data.map(preprocess).batch(10)

    # YOUR CODE TO TRAIN A MODEL HERE
    return model


# Note that you'll need to save your model as a .h5 like this.
# When you press the Submit and Test button, your saved .h5 model will
# be sent to the testing infrastructure for scoring
# and the score will be returned to you.
